                    <h2>Trim your waste</h2>
                    <p>Garbage buried in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Keep stuff out of landfills by composting kitchen scraps and garden trimmings, and recycling paper, plastic, metal and glass. Let store managers and manufacturers know you want products with minimal or recyclable packaging.

                    <h2>Choose Renewable Power</h2>
                    <p>Ask your utility to switch your account to clean, renewable power, such as from wind farms. If it doesn't offer this option yet, ask it to.</p>

                    <h2>Fly less</h2>
                    <p>Air travel leaves behind a huge carbon footprint. Before you book your next airline ticket, consider greener options such as buses or trains, or try vacationing closer to home. You can also stay in touch with people by videoconferencing, which saves time as well as travel and accommodation costs.</p>

                    <h2>Stay Home</h2>
                    <p>I know what you're thinking. Staying home is lame. Well it is but the older you get the more you will enjoy it and younger people will seem more and more annoying. They are annoying me right now and i am home alone. Staying home will definitely make you have less of a carbon footprint. What harm could you do in your pjs on the couch.
